# 🎯 SENTIMENT DATA PERSISTENCE FIX - VERIFICATION GUIDE

## 🔍 Root Cause Identified and Fixed

**Problem**: Race condition between component cleanup and async MediaRecorder completion
**Location**: `/src/components/ExperimentView.tsx` lines 139 and 487
**Issue**: `sentimentData` state cleared on unmount before `onComplete()` callback executed

## ✅ Fix Applied

### Before (Broken):
```typescript
// Line 139: Cleanup effect clears sentimentData immediately on unmount
setSentimentData([]);

// Line 487: onComplete called later in async MediaRecorder.onstop
onComplete(sentimentData, captureId); // sentimentData now empty!
```

### After (Fixed):
```typescript
// Lines 344-349: Capture sentimentData immediately before async operations
const capturedSentimentData = [...sentimentData];
console.log("🔒 Captured sentiment data for submission:", {
  dataPointCount: capturedSentimentData.length,
  firstPoint: capturedSentimentData[0]?.timestamp,
  lastPoint: capturedSentimentData[capturedSentimentData.length - 1]?.timestamp
});

// Line 497: Use captured data instead of potentially cleared state
onComplete(capturedSentimentData, captureId);
```

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### 1. Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. Open Browser and Test
1. Navigate to the experiment page
2. **Open Browser Console** (F12 → Console tab)
3. Start the experiment and let it run for 10-15 seconds
4. Stop the experiment or let it complete naturally

### 3. Verify Fix in Console Output

#### ✅ Expected Success Output:
```
🔒 Captured sentiment data for submission: {
  dataPointCount: 25,
  firstPoint: 0.5,
  lastPoint: 14.8
}
📊 Sentiment data submission: { dataPointCount: 25 }
```

#### ❌ Previous Failure Output:
```
📊 Sentiment data submission: { dataPointCount: 0 }
```

### 4. Database Verification
After running the experiment, check the user_sentiment table should now contain data.

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Files Modified:
- `/src/components/ExperimentView.tsx`
  - Lines 341-351: Added captured data with logging
  - Line 497: Use captured data in MediaRecorder completion
  - Lines 576-583: Same fix for no-video completion path
  - Lines 596, 608, 611: Use captured data in all onComplete calls

### Key Changes:
1. **Data Capture**: Create immutable copy of sentimentData before async operations
2. **Race Prevention**: Captured data immune to state cleanup during component unmount
3. **Logging**: Added diagnostic logs to verify data preservation
4. **Consistency**: Applied fix to both video and no-video completion paths

## 🎉 Expected Results

1. **Console logs show**: `dataPointCount > 0` instead of `dataPointCount: 0`
2. **Database now populated**: user_sentiment table contains emotion data
3. **Admin dashboard shows data**: Visualization charts display captured emotions
4. **No more 201 Created with empty data**: Server receives actual sentiment arrays

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

If the fix doesn't work:

1. **Clear browser cache** and reload
2. **Check console errors** for other issues
3. **Verify face detection works** (green indicator in webcam preview)
4. **Ensure webcam permissions** are granted
5. **Test with different video duration** (longer = more data points)

## 🔬 Debug Script Available

Use the existing debug script for deeper investigation:
```javascript
// In browser console after running experiment:
testSentimentDebug()
```

This fix resolves the core issue where sentiment data was being captured correctly but lost due to React state management timing issues.
