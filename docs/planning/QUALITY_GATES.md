# Quality Gates - Analysis-Driven Development
## Facial Sentiment Analysis MVP

**Purpose**: Systematic quality checkpoints to ensure technical debt resolution and production readiness  
**Based on**: Codebase Analysis findings (B+ → A- improvement plan)  
**Integration**: Quality gates embedded in 4-week MVP timeline

## 📊 Quality Gate Framework

### Gate Philosophy
Each quality gate represents a **go/no-go decision point** where specific criteria must be met before proceeding to the next development phase. These gates are designed to systematically address the analysis findings while maintaining development velocity.

### Gate Structure
```
📋 CRITERIA: Measurable requirements
🔍 VALIDATION: How to verify criteria are met
⚠️ FAILURE ACTION: What to do if gate fails
```

### **🔍 VALIDATION METHODS**
```bash
# Security Validation Commands
1. Bundle Security Check:
   npm run build && grep -r "eyJh" dist/
   # Expected: No results (no exposed keys)

2. Admin Auth Test:
   curl -X GET https://[project]/all-demographics
   # Expected: 401 Unauthorized

3. CORS Test:
   curl -H "Origin: https://malicious-site.com" https://[project]/health
   # Expected: CORS error

4. Database RLS Test:
   # Try accessing data without admin role

2. **Same Day**: Risk evaluation and remediation plan (2 hours)
3. **Next Day**: Implementation of fixes and re-validation (4-8 hours)
4. **Decision Point**: Proceed, delay, or scope reduction

### **Quality Monitoring Alerts**

- **High**: Test coverage drop >5%, bundle size increase >10%
- **Medium**: Code quality metrics decline, documentation gaps

This quality gate framework ensures systematic progression from the current B+ (82/100) codebase to a production-ready A+ (96/100) application while maintaining development velocity and addressing all identified technical debt.
