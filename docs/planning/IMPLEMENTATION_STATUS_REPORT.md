### 🔄 In Progress (Week 2)

#### 🧪 Testing Infrastructure - PARTIAL (3.34% coverage)
**Current Status**: Basic tests exist but coverage is very low

**Existing Tests**:
- ✅ Basic component tests (AdminLogin, WebcamSetup, FacialSentimentAnalysis)
- ✅ Security penetration tests (100% security score)
- ✅ Integration tests (sentiment workflow, video upload)
- ✅ Performance tests (memory leaks, lighthouse audit)
- ✅ Build validation tests

**Coverage Gap Analysis**:
- Current: 3.34% overall coverage
- Target: 80% coverage
- Gap: Need to increase coverage by ~77%

**Components Needing Tests**:
- [ ] App.tsx (0% coverage)
- [ ] AdminDashboard.tsx (0% coverage)
- [ ] DemographicForm.tsx (0% coverage)
- [ ] ExperimentView.tsx (0% coverage)
- [ ] PrivacyModal.tsx (0% coverage)
- [ ] Utils and helpers (0% coverage)

### 📝 Remaining Tasks for MVP

#### Week 2: Complete Testing (Priority: HIGH)
1. **Increase Test Coverage to 80%**
   - Write comprehensive unit tests for all components
   - Add integration tests for data flow
   - Implement E2E tests with Playwright
   - Focus on critical paths and user journeys

#### Week 3: Deployment & CI/CD
1. **CI/CD Pipeline Setup**
   - GitHub Actions workflow configuration
   - Automated testing on PR
   - Build and deployment automation

2. **Vercel Deployment**
   - Environment variable configuration
   - Staging and production environments
   - Performance monitoring setup

3. **Sentry Integration**
   - Error tracking setup
   - Performance monitoring
   - User session replay

#### Week 4: Final Validation
1. **User Acceptance Testing**
   - Recruit 5-10 test participants
   - Collect feedback and iterate
   - Performance validation

2. **Production Launch**
   - Final bug fixes
   - Documentation completion
   - Monitoring setup

## 🎯 Critical Path Items

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. **Database Migration Execution**
   - Run SQL migrations in Supabase Dashboard
   - Verify table creation and constraints
   - Test data flow end-to-end

2. **Admin User Setup**
   - Create admin user in Supabase Auth
   - Link to admin_users table
   - Test admin login flow

3. **Test Coverage Improvement**
   - Focus on critical business logic first
   - Ensure authentication flows are tested
   - Add data validation tests

### Risk Mitigation:
- ✅ Security vulnerabilities addressed
- ✅ Memory leaks fixed
- ⚠️ Test coverage below target (needs immediate attention)
- ✅ Privacy compliance implemented

---

## 📈 Technical Debt Status

### Resolved:
- ✅ Exposed API keys → Environment variables
- ✅ Memory leaks → Proper cleanup implemented
- ✅ Missing authentication → JWT system added
- ✅ Privacy concerns → Threshold enforcement

### Remaining:
- ⚠️ Low test coverage (3.34% vs 80% target)
- ⚠️ Bundle size optimization (1.47MB, target <1MB)
- ℹ️ Cross-browser testing pending
- ℹ️ Performance optimization opportunities

---

## 🚦 Go/No-Go Decision Points

### Ready for Production: ❌ Not Yet
**Blockers**:
1. Test coverage below 80% threshold
2. Database migrations not executed
3. Admin users not configured
4. CI/CD pipeline not implemented

### Ready for Staging: ✅ Yes
**Completed**:
- Core functionality implemented
- Security hardening complete
- Privacy protection in place
- Memory management fixed

---

## 📅 Revised Timeline

### This Week (Week 1): ✅ 95% Complete
- Remaining: Execute database migrations

### Next Week (Week 2): Focus on Testing
- Priority: Achieve 80% test coverage
- Timeline: 3-4 days intensive testing

### Week 3: Deployment
- CI/CD setup: 2 days
- Staging deployment: 1 day
- Monitoring setup: 2 days

### Week 4: Launch
- UAT: 2 days
- Bug fixes: 1 day
- Production launch: 1 day
- Documentation: 1 day

## 💡 Recommendations

1. **Immediate Priority**: Execute database migrations and verify data flow
2. **High Priority**: Improve test coverage to meet 80% target
3. **Medium Priority**: Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated quality checks
4. **Low Priority**: Bundle size optimization (can be post-MVP)

---

## 📞 Next Steps

1. Execute database migrations in Supabase Dashboard
2. Create and configure admin user (john@expectedx.com)
3. Begin intensive test writing sprint
4. Validate end-to-end data flow
5. Prepare for staging deployment
